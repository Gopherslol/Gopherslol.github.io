					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>About 40 years ago, I had an idea for a comic strip.  A stick-figure drawing of a rock and flower who argued and insulted each other constantly.  I drew some with lots of swearing and f-bombs.  The rock was a 'square', the flower a peace, love, and brotherhood hippie.  They ended up in a box buried in the back of a closet until a few years ago. Not much happened with them, but a seed was planted and I began thinking about revisiting these characters.  I started drawing them again during the government shutdown a while back.  I was told not to come to work.  So, rather than start any house projects, I drew comics.  It didn't take long to get the feel for these characters, and I still work on them every chance I get.  Sorry house.<br><a href="files/oldstuff.pdf">Take a look at the old comics</a></p>
