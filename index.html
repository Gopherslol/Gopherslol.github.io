					<h2>History</h2>
					<p>About 40 years ago, I had an idea for a comic strip.  A stick-figure drawing of a rock and flower who argued and insulted each other constantly.  I drew some with lots of swearing and f-bombs.  The rock was a 'square', the flower a peace, love, and brotherhood hippie.  They ended up in a box buried in the back of a closet until a few years ago. Not much happened with them, but a seed was planted and I began thinking about revisiting these characters.  I started drawing them again during the government shutdown a while back.  I was told not to come to work.  So, rather than start any house projects, I drew comics.  It didn't take long to get the feel for these characters, and I still work on them every chance I get.  Sorry house.<br><a href="files/oldstuff.pdf">Take a look at the old comics</a></p>

					<p>Most of the comments I get about my comic is about the drawing:  you should make it color; move the sun around; or, you should make it rainy, cloudy, windy; or, have a bug in there; WHY DOESN'T IT EVER CHANGE?!  The world of meadowdrama is simple, rigid, and colorless.  Why? This comic is only about the words, it's about what they think and what they say.  There may be some small changes in the future, but I don't see big changes without big motivation.</p>

					<h2>Author</h2>
					<p>I was born in Elmira N.Y., and grew up in a rural area near the town of Big Flats.  I graduated from Horseheads High School and enlisted in the Air Force.  When I got out I hitchhiked from Spokane across the WA state to Sequim on a Friday in June.  That weekend I met a guy that knew a guy, and started working for Olympic National Park the following Monday.  I still work there.  To contact me, email:  meadowdrama@gmail.com</p>
